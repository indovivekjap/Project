	3 -> 
]

Stage 2 ->
Make use of pytorch to increase animation image operations more accurate.
Change Image extension type. (Ask users to save the file in which format)
Start Operations on Videos - Both user and Camera based.

Stage 3 ->
Add Robust user handling system.
Monetary Security payments and robust concurrent transaction for paid services.
